# CharlesX0101

`IT Systems Specialist | Cybersecurity Learner | Linux + Bash`

I’m Charles, an experienced IT support professional with over a decade of hands-on work in troubleshooting, system configuration, and technical operations. My background spans Apple hardware, Linux environments, and real-world endpoint management.

This GitHub is where I keep track of what I build, break, and learn. I create collections of tools, scripts, and configurations that go beyond support tickets, focusing on systems thinking, security, and automation.

## [ Philosophy ]

I believe in simplicity, clarity, and practical use. I document everything I build, not because it's perfect, but because it's real. Every script here was created to solve a specific problem. If it helped me, maybe it will help someone else too.

## [ Other Interests ]

Outside of work, I enjoy retro gaming, scripting for emulators, and working with digital audio. If it’s technical and worth doing by hand, it likely appears here.
