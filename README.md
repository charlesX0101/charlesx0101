<p><strong>IT Systems Specialist • Cybersecurity Learner • Linux + Bash Enthusiast</strong></p>

<p>
Welcome. I’m charles x0101 an experienced IT support professional with over a decade of hands-on work in troubleshooting, system configuration, and technical operations. My background spans Apple hardware, Linux environments, and real-world endpoint management.
</p>

<p>
This GitHub is where I keep track of what I build, break, and learn. I create a collections of tools, scripts, and configurations that go beyond support tickets, focusing on systems thinking, security, and automation.

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>
I believe in simplicity, clarity, and practical utility. I document everything I build — not because it's perfect, but because it’s real. Every script here was made to solve a specific problem, and if it helped me, maybe it'll help someone else too.

<h2>Other Interests</h2>

<p>
Outside of work, I dig into retro gaming, emulator builds, and music production. Some of my side projects blend tech with these hobbies — scripting tools for game workflows, automating creative pipelines, or just learning by doing.
</p>

<p>If a tool solves a real problem — even in play — it belongs here.</p>
